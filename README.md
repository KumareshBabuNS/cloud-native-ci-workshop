This is my own project for studying Spring Cloud. 

There are 3 projects:
- service: a backend service
- client: a client service consume the backend service above
- proxy: an API gateway by using Zuul

To create the services required to run these services, 
./scripts/create_services.sh

A manifest is created to upload all 3 apps.
